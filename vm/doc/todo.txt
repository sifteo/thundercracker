Correctness:

- Flash block packing and alignment!

Optimization opportunities:

- More thorough (bidirectional) align-slot filling in SVMAlignPass
- Optimize out redundant base pointer validations
- Preserve r1-r7 across function calls. Right now these regs
  are being marked as killed, causing shared parameters to spill
  into other registers unnecessarily.
- More work on identifying opportunities to use imm12 addressing
- Equal optimization weight for all 16-bit instructions? LDRpc alone is
  better than LDRpc plus MOVs, for example.
- Use MOVWi16 instead of LDRpc for RAM symbols (we know they fit in 16 bits)
- More efficient comparison generation (See ARMTargetLowering::getARMCmp)

Debugging support:

- What's left to implement in order to get working Dwarf symbols?
- gdb stub! (Would this work with stock ARM gdb, or would we need a
  special build?)
