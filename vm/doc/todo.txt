Huge optimizations:

- Intelligent function splitting and/or un-inlining!
- Flash block packing!

Medium-sized optimizations:

- Generate offset loads, when we can guarantee it's safe to do so.
- Optimize out redundant base pointer validations

Smaller optimizations:

- More thorough (bidirectional) align-slot filling in SVMAlignPass
- More work on identifying opportunities to use imm12 addressing
- Equal optimization weight for all 16-bit instructions? LDRpc alone is
  better than LDRpc plus MOVs, for example.
- More efficient comparison generation? (See ARMTargetLowering::getARMCmp)
- (Easy) Deduplicate log strings. Probably can be done trivially by changing
  flags on these GlobalValues.

Correctness:

- SVM Test suite!

- Rigorous memory validation
    - Include exception frame size in stackLimit
    - Finish unfinished parts of SvmValidator (Branch targets especially)
    - Test SvmValidator and SvmRuntime with a code fuzzer!

- Extended calling convention
    - more than 8 args
    - by-value, structs...
    - varargs

Nice to have:

- Bogosort code blocks, constpool entries, etc. Spacial ordering beyond a
  one-block granularity matters not at all at runtime, so this may be a cheap
  method to obfuscate binaries with no real performance penalty.

SDK optimization:

- Optimize out double-precision math in System::clock() in most cases, by
  having that function return a class with binop overloads. It can do integer
  math in most cases, and return a float only when explicitly requested.

Debugging support:

- What's left to implement in order to get working Dwarf symbols?
- gdb stub! (Would this work with stock ARM gdb, or would we need a
  special build?)

- Better error and warning messages for slinky!

- Debug symbols and backtraces in simulator SvmDebug! (High priority!)
