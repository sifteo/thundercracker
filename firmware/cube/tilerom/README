 ROM Tileset Generator
=======================

This is the script and source data used for generating the cube's ROM
tileset. This is a specialized set of tiles that we bake into the
firmware ROM. It is allocated a 4kB chunk of our total 16kB ROM space.

These tiles are used primarily for the cube's "idle" mode, i.e. when
they aren't connected to a master. But since these tiles are
universally available, we also want them to be well suited to
'loading' screens, and to debugging.

How is this different from STIR?
================================

STIR is the asset preparation tool used by games. We don't
use STIR for generating the tile ROM, for a few important reasons:

1. The format of the Tile ROM is very specialized, and we don't use
   this same format anywhere else in Thundercracker. So, there's no
   need to develop a particularly general toolset for it.

2. The tile ROM is designed once, prior to manufacturing, and consumed
   many times. Game authors can conceivably use some subset of these
   tiles for loading screens and debugging. So, the contents of this
   map can actually become part of our ABI. We want the generation
   process, then, to be very deterministic.

3. The artwork is all very carefully constructed, with no want or need
   for lossy compression. We're already taking the trouble to manually
   prepare 1/2-bit tiles and palettes.

So, how do I use this tileset?
==============================

As part of the ROM generation process, we'll create an "atlas" that
is effectively a rendering of the 8x8 pixel data you'd get for every
possible 14-bit tile index. This is a much bigger image than the actual
ROM data, since it also accounts for every possible palette and encoding.
But it's effectively a map of every single image that it's possible to
get the firmware to display. So, after we've baked in a particular ROM
tileset, that image is now the palette of tiles that a game designer
gets to work with while in ROM graphics mode.

Index format
============

The ROM tiles use a special index format, different from that used by
normal flash memory addressing:

======== ==============================
Bits     Usage
======== ==============================
15:12    4-bit palette selector
11       Mode. 0: 2-color, 1: 4-color
10:9     Upper 2 bits of address
8        Reserved, always zero
7:1      Lower 7 bits of address
0        Reserved, always zero

This scheme allows selecting one of 16 pre-defined palettes, and interpreting
a particular data pointer either as a 1-bit (monochrome) tile or as a 2-bit
planar image. A 2-bit planar tile is actually structured as two consecutive
1-bit images, each with one bit-plane from the original 4-color tile.

Addresses are always specified in multiples of 8 bytes. This encoding
uses a 9-bit address, which can reach exactly 4 KB of ROM.

Input Files
===========

src-palettes.png
   Contains the palette color definitions. Must be 4x16 pixels. Each pixel
   is taken to be a palette entry.

src-tiles.png
   Master source image for tile data. Must be a multiple of 8x8 pixels, and
   must be 4-color indexed. Each 8x8 tile is examined in order, left to
   right then top to bottom. If the tile contains only two colors, it's encoded
   as a single monochrome tile. If it contains four colors, it's encoded as
   a set of planar tiles. Any tiles which would be exact matches for tiles
   already encoded are discarded.

This means that it's always safe to add new tiles at the end of the
image. This will never cause existing tiles to be reordered, so it
will not break binary compatibility.

Output Files
============

tilerom-atlas.png
   This is a 128x128 tile (1024x1024 pixel) image which represents the rendered
   output for every valid 14-bit index. It will appear to be several copies of
   the ROM tileset, with different palettes and encodings. Each position in this
   image directly corresponds to the bit pattern you'd use to specify that image
   in a background map. This image can be used as an input for STIR.

tilerom.c
   Source code, to be compiled into the firmware ROM.

ROM Font
========

An ASCII font is included in the ROM, for use mainly by debugging or
informational displays. It is at the very top of src-tiles, in ASCII
order starting with character 0x20 (space).

The font is a slightly modified version of the free "Apple ]["
typeface by Ivan Rood: http://www.dafont.com/ivan-oliver.d1555

 - The lowercase p and q were modified to fit in the 8x8 character cell.
 - The tilde was replaced with something a bit cuter.
 - The lowercase t was moved left by one pixel to improve kerning.
