     * Our input is treated as an angle in integer units of 360/8192 degrees.
     * The input parameter is truncated to 13 bits, causing negative values
     * or values greater than 360 degrees to wrap around.

     * The result is a signed fixed point number with 16 bits to the right

     * by the integer 0x10000. Our table stores only the values that fit in
     * 16 bits. We assume anything past the end of the table is 1.0.
